Some examples of Shiny apps I've made

Hydrogen_Station_Credit_Evaluator
Visit here to see the tool in action: https://plotsrus.shinyapps.io/HRI_Credit_Valuator/

This was a tool I created to help my colleagues visualize the implications of a proposed change to the State's Low Carbon Fuel Standard regulation that would award low carbon fuel credits to hydrogen stations based upon the fuel dispensing capacity of the station, not just on the amount of fuel actually dispensed. This was a contentious proposal that ultimately was approved.

CVRP_Survey_Map
Visit here to see the tool in action (the map takes a second to load): https://plotsrus.shinyapps.io/CVRPmapV2/

This was a tool I created to explore the Clean Vehicle Rebate Program survey data on a county level. My colleague was working on an annual report of hydrogen vehicle + station progress and wanted to explore whether much variation existed in survey responses on a county level. This tool allowed quick investigation of those differences without much effort.
